# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app was designed to help users plan and manage events easily. Its main goal was to provide tools for creating, updating, and deleting events while also enabling users to send SMS notifications to attendees. It aimed to address the need for a simple, efficient way to organize events and keep everyone informed without unnecessary complications.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app needed an event dashboard to display all events, a form for creating or editing event details, and an SMS interface to send notifications. The designs focused on clarity and ease of navigation, with straightforward layouts and intuitive input fields. These designs were successful because they were simple to use, minimized confusion, and allowed users to complete tasks quickly without unnecessary steps.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I broke the coding process into smaller tasks, focusing on one feature at a time, like event management or SMS integration. This modular approach helped me stay organized and made debugging easier. I also tested each feature as it was completed to ensure everything worked before moving on. This approach can be reused in future projects to stay on track and deliver functional, reliable apps.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested the app by running it in an emulator and trying different scenarios, like creating events with missing information or sending SMS notifications. I also ran smaller tests on specific parts of the code to make sure each function worked correctly. Testing is important because it helps find and fix issues early, and it showed me where small adjustments were needed, like improving error messages or refining how data was saved.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One of the biggest challenges was getting the SMS feature to work smoothly with the event data. I had to figure out how to integrate an SMS service in a way that felt natural and didnâ€™t overcomplicate things. To solve this, I used an API that was simple to set up and created a test setup to check how messages would work without sending real ones, saving both time and money during development.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The SMS notification feature was where I felt most confident. It required combining several skills, like integrating an external service, managing event data, and ensuring the notifications were sent properly. This part showed I could take a user need and turn it into a practical, reliable feature that added real value to the app.
